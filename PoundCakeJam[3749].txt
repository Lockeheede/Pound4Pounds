->Idea #1: Pound for Pounds
:The cakes are pan. Use the unPounder to turn them pounds. Get paid 1 poundCoin for each poundcake

->Game Loop: Conveor Belt
:The pancakes come in on a conveor belt. 
::Regular pancakes have a green aroma (+1)
::Bad pancakes have a white aroma (-1)
::Super pancakes have a gold aroma (+3)
::conveor eventually speeds up
::there is a timer of 1 to 5 minutes to get as many poundCoins as possible

->Story: Britian Again??
:Britian has taken over Nigeria. You are a lowly cake unPounder Technician who needs to make British/Nigerian Pounds and eventually convert them to naira to fund a revolution and re-gain independence. 
:Everyone loves a good poundCake. Make them in as little time as possible to get the poundCoin you need for funding. 

->Mechanics

:SpawnManager that holds the 3 different cakes and spawns them randomly
:A button for the technician to press to make the unPounder operate
::unPounder has a cooldown, it can't be spammed
